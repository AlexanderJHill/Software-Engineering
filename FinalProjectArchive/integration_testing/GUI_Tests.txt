Integration tests on the GUI were focused on elements and objects that depended on other objects in some form. These included checking that: 

- state change in a slider correctly modifies the value in a corresponding text box. 

- state change in an element could correctly print text to the log.

- button presses triggered their corresponding functions in Qt’s ‘signals’ and ‘slots’ paradigm, with objects like buttons being able to emit signals that run a function (‘slot’).

- button groupings behaved properly, i.e. only one radio button can be selected at a time, and access to them is controlled by the enable checkbox.

- the report generation button shows the report generation window.

- the plot objects were correctly contained and displayed in the tabbed view.

- the document could be saved as a PDF properly.

If unable to confirm correct behavior visually, text was written to the log to confirm events like button presses. These tests are present in the accompanying demo1 code.
